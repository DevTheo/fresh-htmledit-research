# Fresh HtmlEdit research
This project is to try to find a Html (Content Editable) Rich Text editor that can be used with Deno Fresh. The major issue with Deno Fresh (that I can see) is that everything is Server-Side Rendered (or at least events are expected to be handled on the server side). Ultimately I want to create a control that can be dropped into a Deno Fresh project.

Started" guide here: https://fresh.deno.dev/docs/getting-started

### Usage

Make sure to install Deno: https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation

Then start the project:

This will watch the project directory and restart as necessary.
